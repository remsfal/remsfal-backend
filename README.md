# Open Source Facility Management Software (Backend)

`remsfal-backend` is a backend service built using Java and Quarkus framework to manage real estate projects.
It works together with the [`remsfal-frontend`](https://github.com/remsfal/remsfal-frontend) repository.  
You can see a live version at https://remsfal.online.


## Architecture

The project is structured into multiple modules:

- **[remsfal-core](remsfal-core/README.md)**: A library containing core business models and API interfaces.
- **[remsfal-common](remsfal-services/remsfal-common/README.md)**: A library containing implementations used in all microservices.
- **[remsfal-chat](remsfal-services/remsfal-chat/README.md)**: A microservice responsible for all chat correspondence and document storage.
- **[remsfal-notification](remsfal-services/remsfal-notification/README.md)**: A microservice responsible for all customer notifications.
- **[remsfal-platform](remsfal-services/remsfal-platform/README.md)**: The most important microservice, which is responsible for core functionalities such as user login, metadata storage, etc.
